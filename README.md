# canvas-particles

A collection of experiments while learning HTML canvas and JavaScript built around a "particle" class
Currently none of these examples are interactive however I intend of making it possible to adjust parameters interactively.

- [fireworks](https://samworth27.github.io/canvas-particles/fireworks.html)
  - Click for a firework
- [boids](https://samworth27.github.io/canvas-particles/boids.html) Undergoing some changes
  - TODO:
    - Find out why the boids prefer a clockwise rotation
- [Particle V2](https://samworth27.github.io/canvas-particles/emitter.html)
  - New system built from emitters, particles and reusable particle descriptors
  - Includes basic physics based particles (gravity + friction)
  - TODO: 
    - continue documenting emitter and particle options
    - move fireworks to new particle system
    - Fix issue with low speed and high drag particles
